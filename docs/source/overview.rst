The user is required to provide the spec files in the plugin. 

**Details on how to write the YAML spec files can be found here**: `Spec Documentation <https://riscv-config.readthedocs.io/en/latest/yaml-specs.html>`_


Working
-------
The ISA and Platform spec(obtained from the DUT plugin) are validated using *riscv-config*.

From the standard YAMLs generated by riscv-config and the test-pool, the 'Test Selector' identifies the list of all tests that need to run on the given implementation for compliance.

The list of tests, implmentation-plugin and golden-plugin are all fed into the python-framework, which iterates over executing tests on the both the plugins and comparing signatures. The result of the tests if provided at the end as a report indicating which tests passed and which failed.
