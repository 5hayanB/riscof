The user is required to provide the spec files in the plugin. 

**Details on how to write the YAML spec files can be found here**: `Spec Documentation <https://riscv-config.readthedocs.io/en/latest/yaml-specs.html>`_


Working
-------
The ISA and Platform spec (in YAML format) need to be provided by the DUT plugin through the abstract method class
interface.

These YAML files are validated by the *riscv-config* module.

The Database of tests is maintained in a test list YAML (test_list.yaml). This file is generated using the
*dbgen* module. 

From the standard YAMLs generated by riscv-config (ISA and Platform) and the test-list, the 'Test Selector' identifies the list of all tests that need to run on the given implementation for compliance.

The list of tests, implementation-plugin and golden-plugin are all fed into the python-framework, which iterates over executing tests on the both the plugins and comparing signatures. The result of the signature comparison is provided at the end as a report indicating the pass/fail status.
