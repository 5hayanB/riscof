Welcome to RISCOF 
=================


**RISCOF** (RISC-V Compliance Framework) is a YAML based framework which can be used to prove compliance of a RISC-V implementation against the RISC-V privileged and unprivileged ISA spec. 

**Caution**: This is still a work in progress and non-backward compatible changes are expected to happen. 

For more information on the official RISC-V compliance and test suite please visit: `Github <https://github.com/riscv/riscv-compliance>`_

The user is required to provide the spec files in the plugin. 
For details on how to write the spec files can be found here: `Spec Documentation <https://rifle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/yaml-specs.html>`_

Working:
^^^^^^^^^
The ISA and Platform spec(obtained from the DUT plugin) are validated using *rifle*.

From the standard YAMLs generated by rifle and the test-pool, the 'Test Selector' identifies the list of all tests that need to run on the given implementation for compliance.

The list of tests, implmentation-plugin and golden-plugin are all fed into the python-framework, which iterates over executing tests on the both the plugins and comparing signatures. The result of the tests if provided at the end as a report indicating which tests passed and which failed.
